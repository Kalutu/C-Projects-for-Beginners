# Guess the Number Game
This is a simple console-based "Guess the Number" game implemented in C.

## How to Play
- Clone the repository or download the source code.
- Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g. GCC).
- Run the executable file.
- The game will generate a random number between 1 and 10.
- The player will be prompted to guess the number.
- The game will indicate whether the guess is too high or too low.
- The player continues guessing until they correctly guess the number.
- Once the player correctly guesses the number, the game will display the number of attempts it took to guess the number.
- The game will also save the high score in a text file named "high_score.txt". If a high score already exists in the file, the game will update it if the new high score is lower.
- The player can play again by running the executable file again.

## Files
- main.c: The main source code file that implements the game logic.
- high_score.txt: A text file that stores the high score.

## Requirements
This game requires a C compiler (e.g. GCC) to compile the source code.
