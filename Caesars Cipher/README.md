# Ceaser-Crytography
## Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption
Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that is used to shift each letter of the plaintext by a certain number of places down the alphabet. 
The same technique can also be used to decrypt the ciphertext by shifting each letter back up the alphabet by the same number of places.

## Usage
The Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption program takes three inputs: the plaintext or ciphertext message, the shift value, and the mode (encryption or decryption). The output is the ciphertext or plaintext message, respectively.
