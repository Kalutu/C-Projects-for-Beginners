# Caesar Cipher
This is a simple program written in C that implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified key.

## Features
- Encrypt a message: Users can enter a message and a key to encrypt the message using the Caesar cipher.
- Decrypt an encrypted message: Users can enter an encrypted message and the corresponding key to decrypt the message.

## Usage
1. Compile the program:
    ```
   $ gcc -o caesar_cipher caesar_cipher.c
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```
    $ ./caesar_cipher
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt messages.


## Customization
- You can modify the code to support different encryption algorithms or implement additional features.
- Feel free to customize the program to suit your specific requirements.
