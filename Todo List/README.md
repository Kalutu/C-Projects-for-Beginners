# To-Do List
This is a simple command-line program written in C that allows users to create and manage a to-do list. Users can add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and remove tasks from the list. The program provides an intuitive menu-based interface for interacting with the to-do list.

## Features
- Add tasks: Users can add tasks to the to-do list by entering a task description.
- Mark tasks as complete: Users can mark tasks as complete by specifying the task index.
- Remove tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by specifying the task index.
- Display tasks: The program displays the tasks and their statuses (completed or not) in a formatted manner.

## Usage
1. Compile the program:
    ```
    $ gcc -o todo_list todo_list.c
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```
    $ ./todo_list
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform various actions on the to-do list.

## Customization
- You can modify the maximum number of tasks (`MAX_TASKS`) by changing the value in the code.
- Feel free to extend the program with additional features or enhancements to suit your needs.
